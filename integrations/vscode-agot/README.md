# VS Code Extension for Adaptive Graph of Thoughts

This extension adds a command **"AGoT: Ask Graphâ€¦"** to the Command Palette. It prompts for a question, sends it to the running Adaptive Graph of Thoughts server via `/nlq`, and displays the response in a simple Webview.


## Development

1. Run `npm install` in this folder.
2. Press `F5` in VS Code to launch an Extension Development Host.

The extension is not published to the Marketplace. You can package it locally with `vsce package` if desired.
